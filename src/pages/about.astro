            text1=`My name is Taylor Violet Ross and I am a multidisciplinary artist with a specialized masters in forensic art. 
            After having a deep fascination with both art and forensic science independently, I now work to find a coexistence between the 
            two and further both within the lens of the other. I pride myself on being an artist with a grasp on many mediums, which 
            includes traditional (Drawing, Painting), digital (Adobe workspaces, Procreate), 3D (Traditional sculpture, 3D digital sculpting)
            and a love for unconventional materials.`
            
            text2=`I am also proficient and have received training in many forensic art techniques, including craniofacial approximations 
            (3D manual, 3D digital, 2D), craniofacial superimpositions, forensic photography, composite sketching 
            (including cognitive interviewing), artificial age progressions, postmortem depictions, and facial image comparison.`

            text1=`I received my Bachelor of Fine Art (Honours) in Cross Disciplinary Art: Life Studies from OCAD University (Toronto, Canada) 
            in 2023. My Journey at OCADU started in the Drawing & Painting program, but I soon switched to the Life Studies program in my 
            second year under the amazing guidance of program leads Amy Swartz and Natalie Wahlburger. Life Studies is a program that combines
            artistic creation and exploration with themes of anatomy, biology, ecology, sustainability and nature. In my time at OCADU I was 
            able to take part in multiple public art shows and exhibitions, including the “Propinquity” thesis show at Gallery 1313 in 2023 and 
            an early 2020 Poetry show at the A.G.O under the tutelage of Lillian Allen.`/>

            text1=`I received my Masters of Science in Forensic Art & Facial Imaging (Merit) from the University of Dundee (Dundee, Scotland) 
            in 2024. This program allowed me to fully immerse myself in practical applications of art within the world of science under the 
            expert guidance of Dr. Tobias Houlton (Forensic Art program lead), Dr. Caroline Erolin (Medical Art program lead), and a 
            wide array of global guest lecturers within the Forensic, Medical, and Art fields.`

            text2=`Our first semester was mixed with the MSc Medical Art program so I was able to learn basic knowledge of Medical illustration, 
            and our second semester was fully focused on applications of forensic art. For one of my self directed projects of the second 
            semester I was able to work with CECAS (City of Edinburgh Council Archeology Service) to do a Craniofacial approximation of a 
            medieval skull from Leith, Edinburgh. For my third semester dissertation I focused on the gendered aspects within current 
            Craniofacial approximation standards and how to make these practices more inclusive to trans-feminine individuals. 
            This project focused on secondary identifiers within remains and how these can show a possible transgender identity, 
            historical examples of trans-feminine remains and approximations, as well as correlations between hormone therapy and 
            soft tissue thickness.`
