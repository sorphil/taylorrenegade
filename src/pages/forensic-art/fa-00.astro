        year=`2024`
        subtitle=`Materials: Geomagic Freeform, 3D Printed Models, Procreate, Adobe Illustrator, Acrylic Paint`
        text1=`In forensic science, the identification of human remains often relies on clear and binary categorizations, 
        but often people's identities and senses of self cannot be contained to simple black-and-white answers. 
        Moreover, this binary system fails to account for the complexities of transgender identities, posing significant challenges 
        to identification. Sex estimation affects the language used to describe remains which in turn influences forensic art. 
        Forensic artists, particularly those working in craniofacial approximations, strive to accurately recreate an individual's 
        appearance to aid in their identification. To aid in a successful identification many different pieces of information are needed, 
        and an omission or oversight can hinder this. This is further compacted by the fact that even when information about the transgender 
        identity of an individual is made available to the forensic artist, there are no current standards for creating a trans-inclusive 
        approximation. This, as well as a history of disregarding or lacking knowledge on these signs, can lead to inaccurate and 
        disrespectful representations (Tallmana, Kincera, Plemons, 2021; Redgrave, 2018).`
        
        text2=`This project aims to propose new standards for conducting craniofacial approximations that respect and 
        appropriately reflect trans-feminine identities. By applying masculine, feminine, and gender-neutral craniofacial 
        approximation standards to the same male skull, the project will compare the outcomes and how these different gendered 
        standards affect the final approximations. This will hopefully help establish guidelines for suspected trans-feminine 
        remains; an identity that is underrepresented in current forensic standards and research.`
