        text1=`As part of our Artificial Age Progression training we were tasked with creating both childhood and adult progressions. 
        The in class images and cases we worked on are confidential and canâ€™t be shared, but this one is an extra credit childhood age 
        progression that I got my partner to source images for. This practice age progression is of a 10 year old Filipino boy, and the 
        target age of the final progression was 20-25. Artificial Age Progressions are an important facet of forensic art, using images of 
        a target individual and creating a visualization of what they may look like currently. In cases of missing children this is 
        especially important, as it both can bring new light to a case as well as help people visualize how much said child's face may 
        have changed with age.`
