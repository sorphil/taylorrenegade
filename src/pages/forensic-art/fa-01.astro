        text1=`This is a self-directed project as part of my MSc Forensic Art & Facial Imaging course, in collaboration with 
        the City Of Edinburgh Council Archeological Service (CECAS). I was provided a a 3D scan of a Medieval skull from Leith, 
        Edinburgh and decided to do a digital 3D Craniofacial Approximation. This project was mainly done in GeoMagic FreeForm, 
        and then a final texturing was done in 2D digitally overtop of the reconstruction within Procreate, as well as another 
        traditional drawing done with alcohol markers using the 3D reconstruction as a reference. This portfolio will show each step
         I took to get to the final product and include all of the relevant research I did to inform my reconstruction. `
