        text1=`Composite sketching is an important real world application of forensic art, being able to replicate a human likeness 
        from eyewitness testimony. This is a collection of composite sketches I created as part of my MSc Forensic Art & Facial Imaging 
        course. The sketches without a witness signature were created looking through the Samantha Steinberg catalogue with written cues
        provided by my instructor, and the ones with a witness signature were created through simulated cognitive interviews.
        Cognitive interviews are where a forensic artist talks to and guides the eyewitness through describing the facial features and 
        likeness of an individual, doing their best at creating a sketch that mimics their memory. These cognitive interviews were 
        set up by our professor to mimic real world interview dynamics as much as possible.`
