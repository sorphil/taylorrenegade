        text1=`For this project, I was asked to create a wax ecorche over top of a plastic skull, showing both the skin layer and parts of 
        the structures that lay beneath. I was also tasked with adding an extra anatomical context to the piece, whether that be a 
        pathological, surgical, forensic, historical or any visual aspect that would change or alter the structures of the face.`
        text2=`I chose to take a gender affirming healthcare approach, doing a visual representation of Facial Feminization Surgery (FFS). 
        FFS is a series of procedures that in essence are done to feminize the appearance of the face, usually involving alteration of the 
        underlying bone structure. The 3D printed skull was also deemed to be male, so through trying to mimic these skeletal procedures 
        on the skull and adding the wax overtop, I was able to simulate how these skeletal procedures can affect facial soft tissue.`
