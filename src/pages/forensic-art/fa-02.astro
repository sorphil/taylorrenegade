        text1=`This is a self directed project as part of my MSc Forensic Art and Facial Imaging Course. Ever since I can remember, 
        Giraffes have always been my favourite animal. I was able to get access to a 3D scanned giraffe skull through Geoffrey Marchal 
        on SketchFab, and 3D printed the skull twice to use within this project. One giraffe is a full reconstruction looking to recreate 
        a finished likeness of the giraffe, and one is an ecorche showing both the muscle and bone layers.`
