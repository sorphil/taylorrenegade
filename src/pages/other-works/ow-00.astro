        text2=` Amensalism is my undergraduate thesis work, which personifies illness and trauma through the lens of a biological wire structure consuming 
                the human form. It was my way of exploring and revisiting hard moments and realities of my past, and making a physical representation of moments 
                where it felt like I wouldn't be able to survive these experiences. The self portrait aspects of this piece were done with watercolour paper and 
                alcohol markers, being integrated into a 3D wire sculpture consuming these pieces. Each individual wire was cut, shaped, and glued onto a 
                sculpted plaster wrap base, giving the impression of muscle fibres and a more biological look. This piece took 8 months to create, spanning 
                over 2 thesis semesters`
