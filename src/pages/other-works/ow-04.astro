        After I got out of the hospital, I didn't create any art for close to 6 months. This piece was my first time allowing myself to 
        create, with the support of my professor Tannis Nielsen. It is a depiction of trauma as a physical entity that can interact and 
        apply pressure to your skin, showing internal struggles as something external. The imagery also came from my own experience with sleep 
        paralysis, and that feeling of unseen entities pushing and pulling at your body.`
